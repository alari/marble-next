# Database Models Implementation Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-04

## Current Status
We've implemented Rust models for the core database tables (users, folders, files) with appropriate functionality and comprehensive test coverage.

## Accomplished
- Created Rust structs for the three core database tables:
  * `User`: Model for authenticated users with login tracking
  * `Folder`: Model for directory structure with hierarchical relationships
  * `File`: Model for file metadata and content references
- Added helper methods for common operations:
  * Path manipulation and extraction (name, extension, parent path)
  * Content type detection (markdown, canvas)
  * Timestamp tracking for updates
  * Deletion and restoration management
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for all models
  * 15 tests covering all key functionality
  * 100% test pass rate
- Added necessary dependencies to the crate
  * chrono for date/time handling
  * serde for serialization

## Key Insights
- Models should combine data representation with domain logic
- Paths need special handling for hierarchical operations
- Test coverage is essential for model correctness
- Well-structured models simplify query implementation
- Content type detection helps with format-specific processing

## Design Decisions
- Used i32 for database IDs matching PostgreSQL SERIAL type
- Added helper methods for common operations to encapsulate logic
- Implemented content type detection through both MIME type and extensions
- Used chrono with Utc time zone for consistent timestamp handling
- Applied serde derive macros for serialization/deserialization
- Retained deleted items with soft deletion for recovery
- Made paths relative to user root for multi-tenant isolation

## Next Steps
- Implement database queries for CRUD operations on models
- Create repository patterns for database access
- Add SQLx query functions for model fetching and persistence
- Implement transactions for atomic operations
- Create higher-level services that coordinate model operations
- Add validation logic for model integrity
