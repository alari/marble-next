# Dependencies Update Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-03

## Current Status
We've added all required dependencies to support the database and core functionality of Marble, along with comprehensive documentation.

## Accomplished
- Added and configured key dependencies for the Marble project:
  * **Database**: SQLx with PostgreSQL, JSON, time handling, and custom type mapping
  * **Configuration**: dotenv for environment variable management
  * **Logging**: tracing and tracing-subscriber for structured logging
  * **Serialization**: serde and serde_json for data structure serialization
  * **Time Handling**: chrono for date/time operations
  * **Content Handling**: gray_matter for frontmatter parsing, base64 for encoding/decoding, mime and mime_guess for MIME types
  * **Async Runtime**: Updated tokio and added tokio-stream, tokio-util, and async-trait
- Created documentation for all major dependencies:
  * Added documentation in `spec/dependencies/` for SQLx, OpenDAL, dotenv, tracing, serde, chrono
  * Documented usage patterns relevant to the Marble project
  * Added code examples for common operations
- Organized dependencies in the Cargo.toml file by functional area
- Updated the dependencies index with information about all added libraries

## Key Insights
- SQLx with the postgres feature provides sufficient PostgreSQL type mapping capabilities without needing a separate postgres-types crate
- The tracing ecosystem offers better structured logging than the traditional log crate
- For frontmatter parsing, gray_matter is the best fit as it supports YAML, TOML, and JSON formats
- The tokio ecosystem (tokio, tokio-stream, tokio-util) provides comprehensive async I/O capabilities

## Design Decisions
- Used SQLx rather than Diesel or Postgres-native libraries for type-safe SQL operations with async support
- Selected dotenv for configuration to allow easy development setup and production deployment
- Chose tracing over log for enhanced structured logging and context propagation
- Added serde with derive feature to enable automatic serialization/deserialization
- Configured chrono with serde support for seamless DateTime handling in JSON
- Expanded tokio features to include file system, I/O utilities, synchronization, and time

## Next Steps
- Consider documenting the remaining dependencies:
  * Complete documentation for gray_matter, base64, mime, mime_guess
  * Create documentation for tokio ecosystem (tokio, tokio-stream, tokio-util)
- Begin implementation of the marble-db crate using these dependencies:
  * Create database schema definitions using SQLx migrations
  * Implement core database models with SQLx query macros
  * Set up the connection pool with dotenv configuration
- Set up a local development environment for testing:
  * Create a Docker Compose file for PostgreSQL
  * Configure dotenv for local development
