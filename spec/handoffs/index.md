## Handoff Process

When working on a feature or task:

1. Create a handoff document using the template
2. Update it after each significant work session
3. Include key insights, decisions, and next steps
4. Reference relevant specification documents
5. Keep the "Last updated" timestamp current

At the beginning of a new session, review the handoff document to understand the current state and next steps.
