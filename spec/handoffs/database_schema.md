# Database Schema Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-02

## Current Status
The database schema specification is well-defined but requires some refinements and decisions on open questions. The schema covers user authentication, file tracking, content analysis, and processing orchestration.

## Accomplished
- Reviewed the current database schema specification
- Set up handoffs directory structure
- Added Current Handoffs section to the spec/spec.md file

## Key Insights
- The database schema follows a clear separation of concerns with tenant isolation
- The schema supports versioning, efficient querying, and incremental processing
- There are several open questions that need resolution

## Design Decisions
- PostgreSQL is the chosen database system
- Hash-based storage approach with content-addressable S3 storage
- Separate tables for different aspects (files, frontmatter, references, embeds)
- Processing queue for managing content analysis and transformation

## Known Issues/Limitations
- Several open questions remain regarding permalink handling, frontmatter storage, content hashing conflicts, and error handling
- Need to decide on concurrency strategies for handling simultaneous updates

## Next Steps
- Address the open questions in the database schema specification
- Refine the schema based on decisions
- Prepare for implementation of the database layer (marble-db crate)
- Consider adding index optimizations for common query patterns
