# Marble Storage Implementation Handoff

**Last Updated: 2025-04-06**

## Current Status
Phase 3 of the implementation plan is complete, and we've made significant progress on Phase 4 with our strategic approach. We've also completed key enhancements to the storage implementation.

We've successfully implemented:
1. The `RawStorageBackend` with database integration for tenant isolation
2. A new `TenantStorage` trait that provides a clean, explicit API for tenant-isolated storage
3. A complete implementation of this trait using our existing components
4. Directory support with automatic parent directory creation
5. Enhanced metadata retrieval without requiring full file content loading
6. Content hash exposure in file metadata for verification
7. Comprehensive tests for all functionality

The code now compiles successfully and all tests pass. We've pivoted away from a complex OpenDAL adapter to a more focused approach that directly addresses our core requirements.

## Latest Enhancements

### Directory Support
- Added `create_directory` method to the `TenantStorage` trait
- Implemented recursive directory creation that automatically creates parent directories
- Directory placeholders are created with special metadata in the database
- Tests confirm proper directory isolation between tenants

### Metadata Improvements
- Added a new `get_file_metadata` method to the `RawStorageBackend`
- Metadata is now retrieved directly from the database without loading the file content
- Added content hash to metadata for verification purposes
- Added last modified time to metadata
- Tests confirm proper metadata retrieval

### Testing Enhancements
- Added tests for directory operations and nested directory support
- Added tests for metadata retrieval with content hash verification
- Added tests for tenant isolation with directories
- All tests pass successfully, confirming our implementation is solid

## Tenant Isolation Implementation
Our approach to tenant isolation has proven effective:
- Each file's metadata is stored in the database with a user_id foreign key
- All database queries for file operations are scoped to the specific user_id
- Content is stored in a shared hash-based storage for deduplication
- Tests confirm users cannot access each other's files even with identical paths

## Key Insights from Implementation

### OpenDAL API Usage
- OpenDAL's API requires a two-step process to create an operator:
  1. Create an operator builder with `Operator::new(builder)`
  2. Finish the builder with `.finish()` to get the actual operator
- OpenDAL requires vector content (`Vec<u8>`) for write operations, not references
- Custom adapter implementation is more complex than initially expected

### Storage Architecture Validation
- Content-addressable storage provides effective deduplication
- Tenant isolation through database metadata works correctly
- Metadata and content separation provides a clean architecture
- The system maintains proper tenant boundaries without performance penalties
- Directory operations are fully supported with nested directory creation

### Testing Approach
- Integration tests validate basic operations and tenant isolation
- Tests verify deduplication works correctly across tenant boundaries
- Directory creation and metadata retrieval tests confirm proper functionality
- Ensuring tests pass in both CI and local environments requires careful database setup
- Mock database connections for tests would be valuable in the future

## Implementation Plan

We will focus exclusively on the write side storage implementation in this phase, leaving the read side for a future project. The plan is structured in phases:

### Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies ✅
1. Add OpenDAL with S3 support to dependencies
2. Define a consistent error handling strategy with a dedicated `StorageError` type
3. Implement a configuration system for storage backends to support different environments

### Phase 2: Raw Storage Implementation ✅
1. Create content-addressable hashed storage for raw data
   - Implement storage with `/.hash/{hash}` addressing scheme
   - Cover with unit tests using OpenDAL's file backend
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - This storage will be shared across all tenants since content is addressed by hash

### Phase 3: Tenant Isolation through Metadata ✅
1. Implement tenant isolation primarily through database metadata ✅
   - Store user_id with all file/path metadata in the database
   - Ensure all queries are scoped to the specific user_id
   - No need for tenant-specific partitioning in the hash-based raw storage
   - Use proper authentication and authorization checks before operations
2. Create utilities for user ID conversion and lookup ✅
   - Support conversion between UUID and database user ID
3. Test tenant isolation thoroughly ✅
   - Create integration tests that verify tenant boundaries

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation ⏳
1. Develop comprehensive integration tests
   - Verify cross-service interactions
   - Test concurrent operations from different users
   - Validate edge cases and error handling

### Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization ⏳
1. Update marble-storage specification to match implementation
2. Create usage examples and API documentation
3. Implement any remaining features for the write side

   - Added content hash to metadata for verification
   - Added tests for all new functionality

## Strategic Pivot: Unified Tenant Storage

After evaluating the OpenDAL adapter challenges, we've decided to take a step back and create a simpler, more focused solution. Instead of trying to force our storage model into OpenDAL's framework immediately, we'll:

1. **Create a Unified Storage API**: Design a simpler API that directly addresses our tenant isolation needs
2. **Focus on Core Requirements**: Build around the fundamental operations we need without excess complexity
3. **Defer OpenDAL Integration**: Make an informed decision about OpenDAL after our core functionality is solid

### OpenDAL Adapter Challenges (Findings)

Our investigation into OpenDAL revealed several challenges:

- **Complex API Structure**: OpenDAL's raw API has a complex trait hierarchy with multiple associated types
- **Custom Adapter Requirements**: Implementing a custom adapter requires:
  - Defining six associated types (`Reader`, `Writer`, `Lister`, etc.)
  - Implementing methods with precise signatures that differ from documentation
  - Understanding internal implementation details not accessible to users
- **Deeper Understanding Needed**: A robust implementation requires deeper study of OpenDAL's internals
- **Documentation Updates**: We've updated the OpenDAL dependency documentation with our findings

### Unified Tenant Storage API (Current Implementation)

The implemented `TenantStorage` trait provides a clean, focused API:

```rust
pub trait TenantStorage: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Read a file by path for a specific tenant
    async fn read(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str) -> StorageResult<Vec<u8>>;
    
    /// Write a file at path for a specific tenant
    async fn write(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str, content: Vec<u8>, content_type: Option<&str>) -> StorageResult<()>;
    
    /// Check if a file exists for a tenant
    async fn exists(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str) -> StorageResult<bool>;
    
    /// Delete a file for a tenant
    async fn delete(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str) -> StorageResult<()>;
    
    /// List files for a tenant in a directory
    async fn list(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, dir_path: &str) -> StorageResult<Vec<String>>;
    
    /// Create a directory for a tenant
    async fn create_directory(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str) -> StorageResult<()>;
    
    /// Get metadata for a file for a tenant
    async fn metadata(&self, tenant_id: &Uuid, path: &str) -> StorageResult<FileMetadata>;
}
```

This approach provides several advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Focuses directly on what we need without adapting to complex external APIs
- **Tenant Isolation**: Makes tenant isolation explicit in the API design
- **Directory Support**: Full directory creation and listing capabilities
- **Metadata**: Rich metadata retrieval without loading full file content
- **Flexibility**: Can be implemented using our existing components
- **Future-proof**: Can be adapted to work with OpenDAL later if needed

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the WebDAV integration:
   - Integrate the TenantStorage API with the WebDAV server
   - Map WebDAV operations to TenantStorage operations
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

2. Add performance optimizations:
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed metadata
   - Optimize file listing for large directories
   - Add batch operations for multiple files

3. Implement garbage collection:
   - Create a process for detecting and removing unused content
   - Implement a reference counting mechanism
   - Add safety checks to prevent removing referenced content

4. Update documentation:
   - Document the TenantStorage API usage examples
   - Update the storage architecture documentation
   - Create examples for WebDAV integration

## Testing Notes
- Integration tests require a PostgreSQL database
- Tests will be skipped if no test database is available
- The `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable can be set to override the default connection string
- Both tenant isolation and deduplication tests are now passing
- Directory creation and metadata tests confirm proper functionality
