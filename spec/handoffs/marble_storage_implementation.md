# Marble Storage Implementation Handoff

**Last Updated: 2025-04-04**

## Current Status
Phase 3 of the implementation plan is complete. We've implemented the `RawStorageBackend` with database integration for tenant isolation and comprehensive tests that verify this isolation works correctly. The code now compiles successfully and all tests pass, though the OpenDAL adapter (Phase 4) is still a placeholder that needs to be completed.

## Tenant Isolation Implementation
Our approach to tenant isolation has proven effective:
- Each file's metadata is stored in the database with a user_id foreign key
- All database queries for file operations are scoped to the specific user_id
- Content is stored in a shared hash-based storage for deduplication
- Tests confirm users cannot access each other's files even with identical paths

## Key Insights from Implementation

### OpenDAL API Usage
- OpenDAL's API requires a two-step process to create an operator:
  1. Create an operator builder with `Operator::new(builder)`
  2. Finish the builder with `.finish()` to get the actual operator
- OpenDAL requires vector content (`Vec<u8>`) for write operations, not references
- Custom adapter implementation is more complex than initially expected

### Storage Architecture Validation
- Content-addressable storage provides effective deduplication
- Tenant isolation through database metadata works correctly
- Metadata and content separation provides a clean architecture
- The system maintains proper tenant boundaries without performance penalties

### Testing Approach
- Integration tests validate basic operations and tenant isolation
- Tests verify deduplication works correctly across tenant boundaries
- Ensuring tests pass in both CI and local environments requires careful database setup
- Mock database connections for tests would be valuable in the future

## Implementation Plan

We will focus exclusively on the write side storage implementation in this phase, leaving the read side for a future project. The plan is structured in phases:

### Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies ‚úÖ
1. Add OpenDAL with S3 support to dependencies
2. Define a consistent error handling strategy with a dedicated `StorageError` type
3. Implement a configuration system for storage backends to support different environments

### Phase 2: Raw Storage Implementation ‚úÖ
1. Create content-addressable hashed storage for raw data
   - Implement storage with `/.hash/{hash}` addressing scheme
   - Cover with unit tests using OpenDAL's file backend
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - This storage will be shared across all tenants since content is addressed by hash

### Phase 3: Tenant Isolation through Metadata ‚úÖ
1. Implement tenant isolation primarily through database metadata ‚úÖ
   - Store user_id with all file/path metadata in the database
   - Ensure all queries are scoped to the specific user_id
   - No need for tenant-specific partitioning in the hash-based raw storage
   - Use proper authentication and authorization checks before operations
2. Create utilities for user ID conversion and lookup ‚úÖ
   - Support conversion between UUID and database user ID
3. Test tenant isolation thoroughly ‚úÖ
   - Create integration tests that verify tenant boundaries
   - Test cross-tenant deduplication
   - Ensure proper error handling for authorization issues

### Phase 4: OpenDAL Integration üîÑ
1. Create OpenDAL adapter that integrates with marble-db for metadata üîÑ
   - Implement adapter skeleton ‚úÖ
   - Implement the `raw_storage()` method in MarbleStorageImpl ‚úÖ
   - Add database connection support to MarbleStorageImpl ‚úÖ
   - Complete the OpenDAL adapter implementation ‚è≥
   - Implement proper read/write/list/delete operations in the adapter ‚è≥

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation ‚è≥
1. Develop comprehensive integration tests
   - Verify cross-service interactions
   - Test concurrent operations from different users
   - Validate edge cases and error handling

### Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization ‚è≥
1. Update marble-storage specification to match implementation
2. Create usage examples and API documentation
3. Implement any remaining features for the write side

## Progress Update
We've implemented the following components:

1. **RawStorageBackend**: A backend that enforces tenant isolation through database integration
   - File operations (read, write, delete, list) scoped to specific user_id
   - Integration with ContentHasher for deduplication
   - Proper error handling for database operations

2. **User ID Conversion**: Utilities to convert between UUID and database user ID
   - `uuid_to_db_id()` function for lookup and conversion
   - Security checks for user existence
   - Error handling for database lookup failures

3. **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive tests for the RawStorageBackend
   - Test basic file operations
   - Verify tenant isolation works correctly
   - Confirm content deduplication across tenants
   - All tests pass successfully

4. **OpenDAL Adapter Skeleton**: Started implementing the adapter
   - Basic structure defined
   - Placeholder for full implementation
   - Error handling for unsupported operations

5. **MarbleStorageImpl Updates**: Enhanced to support database connections
   - Added `new_with_db()` method to create with database connection
   - Updated `raw_storage()` method to integrate with RawStorageBackend
   - Added database pool validation and user ID conversion

## OpenDAL Adapter Challenges
We've identified that implementing a custom OpenDAL adapter is more complex than initially expected:
- The OpenDAL Raw API has a complex trait hierarchy
- Custom adapters require implementing multiple traits and associated types
- A robust implementation requires deeper understanding of OpenDAL's internals
- We may need to consider alternative approaches for integration

## Next Steps
1. Complete the OpenDAL adapter implementation:
   - Explore OpenDAL documentation for clearer examples
   - Consider whether a full custom adapter is necessary or if simpler approaches exist
   - Implement the key operations: read, write, delete, list

2. Add comprehensive tests for the adapter:
   - Verify that OpenDAL operations correctly map to underlying storage
   - Test with both filesystem and S3 backends

3. Update documentation and examples:
   - Provide clear usage examples for WebDAV integration
   - Document performance characteristics and limitations

## Testing Notes
- Integration tests require a PostgreSQL database
- Tests will be skipped if no test database is available
- The `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable can be set to override the default connection string
- Both tenant isolation and deduplication tests are now passing
