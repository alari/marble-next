# Database Testing Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-04

## Current Status
We've added a testing infrastructure for the marble-db crate using Docker Compose with PostgreSQL 17. This provides a reliable and isolated environment for testing database schema and queries.

## Accomplished
- Created a Docker Compose configuration for a test database using PostgreSQL 17
- Set up a separate port (5433) to avoid conflicts with development databases
- Added SQL query logging for easier debugging
- Created a setup script to initialize the test environment
- Generated a .env.test file for consistent test configuration
- Added healthcheck to ensure database is ready before tests run

## Key Insights
- Using PostgreSQL 17 provides access to the latest features and performance improvements
- Running tests on a dedicated port (5433) prevents conflicts with other databases
- SQL query logging helps identify performance issues and incorrect queries
- Container-based testing provides consistency across development environments
- Using Docker volumes ensures test data persists between test runs if needed

## Design Decisions
- Selected PostgreSQL 17 for its improved performance and latest features
- Used a dedicated Docker Compose file for testing to keep it separate from development
- Implemented healthcheck to ensure reliable test startup
- Created a setup script to streamline the test environment creation
- Enabled SQL logging to support debugging test failures
- Set SQLX_OFFLINE=true to support compile-time query checking

## Next Steps
- Create a testing module in marble-db with utilities for test database management
- Implement database schema snapshot tests to verify structure
- Add type-safe query testing with SQLx prepare
- Create integration tests for the Database API
- Set up GitHub Actions CI for automated testing
- Develop a standard approach for fixture data
- Add transaction-based test isolation
