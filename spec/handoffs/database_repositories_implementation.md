# Database Repositories Implementation Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-04

## Current Status
We've implemented repository patterns and SQLx query functions for the core database tables (users, folders, files) with comprehensive CRUD operations and tests.

## Accomplished
- Created repository trait definitions for database operations:
  * `UserRepository`: User authentication and management operations
  * `FolderRepository`: Directory structure operations with hierarchical relationships
  * `FileRepository`: File metadata and content operations
- Implemented SQLx-based repository implementations:
  * `SqlxUserRepository`: User CRUD with login tracking
  * `SqlxFolderRepository`: Folder management with hierarchy support
  * `SqlxFileRepository`: File management with content type detection
- Added comprehensive CRUD operations:
  * Create: Insert new records with proper timestamps
  * Read: Find by ID, path, or type-specific criteria
  * Update: Modify existing records with automatic timestamp updates
  * Delete: Both soft deletion (is_deleted flag) and permanent deletion
- Implemented specialized query functions:
  * Content analysis: Find markdown and canvas files
  * Hierarchy navigation: List children, check for children
  * Content deduplication: Find by content hash
  * Pagination support: Listing with limits and offsets
- Added transaction support:
  * Begin/commit/rollback operations
  * Shared transaction trait implementation
- Added unit tests for all repositories that can run on the PostgreSQL 17 test database

## Key Insights
- Repository pattern provides a clean abstraction over database operations
- Transaction support enables atomic operations across multiple tables
- SQLx's type-safe queries minimize runtime errors
- Soft deletion simplifies recovery scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures query correctness

## Design Decisions
- Used trait-based repositories for interface-implementation separation
- Implemented FromRow for model structs to enable query_as
- Created common BaseRepository and TransactionSupport traits for shared functionality
- Added specialized query functions for common application needs
- Used soft deletion by default with optional permanent deletion
- Enabled finding content by type for processing operations
- Implemented hierarchy traversal for folder structures
- Added error conversion from SQLx to custom error types

## Known Issues/Limitations
- Tests rely on an external PostgreSQL 17 instance
- Tests will be skipped if the database is not available
- Large result sets may need pagination for performance

## Next Steps
- Implement higher-level service layer for coordinating repository operations
- Add transaction-based tests for multi-repository operations
- Create repository factory for dependency injection
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Implement metrics and monitoring for database operations
- Integrate with the WebDAV interface
