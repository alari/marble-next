# Marble-DB Implementation Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-04

## Current Status
We've added SQLx support to the marble-db crate with migration functionality, established a proper API interface, and added configuration with dotenv support. The crate is now ready to have schema migrations defined. The code builds successfully.

## Accomplished
- Added SQLx dependency to the marble-db crate
- Created a static MIGRATOR using the sqlx::migrate! macro
- Implemented database configuration and connection pool setup
- Added basic error handling structure
- Created functions for running migrations and database connections
- Fixed compatibility with SQLx 0.8.3 
- Added thiserror to the workspace dependencies for error handling
- Created a proper API interface with DatabaseApi trait
- Implemented the Database struct that implements DatabaseApi
- Added dotenv support for loading configuration from environment variables
- Organized code to follow project guidelines with api.rs module
- Added a helper function to connect and initialize a database in one step

## Key Insights
- SQLx 0.8.3 doesn't have a `connect_timeout` method on the PgPoolOptions, so this was removed during implementation
- The project has a proper workspace structure that makes dependency management cleaner
- The database layout follows the recommended practice of having a migrations folder at the crate root
- Using traits for the database API improves testability and follows the interface-first design principle
- Config values are better managed with environment variables through dotenv

## Design Decisions
- Used a static MIGRATOR for SQLx migrations to ensure consistent schema migrations
- Created a centralized error handling approach with thiserror for better error messages and context
- Added a DatabaseConfig struct to make connection configuration explicit and testable
- Set reasonable defaults for database connection parameters
- Created a trait-based API to allow for mock implementations in tests
- Added dotenv integration with environment variable fallbacks
- Used Arc for thread-safe pool sharing in the Database struct
- Added a health check method to verify database connection

## Next Steps
- Create the first migration file (e.g., `migrations/20250404000001_initial_schema.sql`)
- Implement the database schema according to the database schema specification
- Create models for database entities like users, files, and folders
- Implement query functions for common operations
- Add comprehensive tests for the Database API
- Consider implementing transaction support
