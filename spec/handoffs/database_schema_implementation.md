# Database Schema Implementation Handoff

**Last updated:** 2025-04-04

## Current Status
We've implemented the minimal core database schema with three foundational tables (users, folders, files) and successfully tested the migrations on a PostgreSQL 17 test database.

## Accomplished
- Created three SQL migration files for the core tables:
  * `20250404000001_create_users.sql`: User authentication table
  * `20250404000002_create_folders.sql`: Folder structure table with hierarchical relationships
  * `20250404000003_create_files.sql`: File metadata and content hash table
- Added appropriate indices and foreign key constraints
- Implemented migration tests using the SQLx migrator
- Verified migrations run successfully on PostgreSQL 17
- Confirmed table structure matches specifications

## Key Insights
- The hierarchical structure of folders (self-referencing through parent_id) works as expected
- SQLx migrations provide a clean way to version the database schema
- Testing migrations directly in Rust code ensures they're properly integrated
- PostgreSQL 17 properly enforces all constraints and creates the necessary indices
- The foreign key constraints maintain data integrity between tables

## Design Decisions
- Started with a minimal but functional core schema (users, folders, files)
- Used VARCHAR(1024) for paths to accommodate long paths
- Added appropriate indexes for common query patterns:
  * Username lookups for authentication
  * Path lookups for file/folder access
  * Content hash lookups for deduplication
  * Parent relationships for folder hierarchy
  * Deleted status filtering
- Created unique constraints for user+path combinations to prevent duplicates
- Used TIMESTAMPTZ (with timezone) for all timestamps to ensure consistency

## Known Issues/Limitations
- The schema currently supports basic file and folder operations but lacks:
  * File versioning
  * Content analysis (frontmatter, document links)
  * Processing queue tables
  * Publication status tracking

## Next Steps
- Implement the remaining tables in subsequent migrations:
  * `file_versions` for version history
  * `frontmatter` for extracted metadata
  * `document_links` for file relationships
  * `processing_queue` for background processing
  * `published_content` for tracking published content
- Create database models to represent these tables in Rust
- Implement query functions for common operations
- Add database transaction support
- Create comprehensive tests with test fixtures
