# tower Specification

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-05

## Overview

Tower is a library of modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers. It provides a middleware abstraction based on the "Service" concept, allowing composition of behavior like timeouts, rate limiting, load balancing, and more.

## Usage in Marble

In the Marble project, Tower provides:

- Middleware infrastructure for our Axum web server
- Service abstraction for handling WebDAV requests
- Composable components for cross-cutting concerns like tracing and authentication

## Version and Features

- Current version: 0.4.13
- Required features: Default features are sufficient
- Version constraints: Compatible with Axum 0.8.x

## Configuration

Tower is primarily used through Axum's middleware system:

```rust
let app = Router::new()
    .route("/*path", any(handle_webdav))
    // Add middleware using Tower's layer system
    .layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http())
    .layer(CompressionLayer::new())
    .with_state(state);
```

## Key APIs and Patterns

The core Tower concept is the `Service` trait:

```rust
pub trait Service<Request> {
    type Response;
    type Error;
    type Future: Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>;

    fn poll_ready(&mut self, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Self::Error>>;
    fn call(&mut self, req: Request) -> Self::Future;
}
```

This abstraction allows composition of services through middleware.

## Error Handling

- Tower errors propagate through the service stack
- Each layer can handle or transform errors
- Final error handling occurs at the Axum handler level
- Enables centralized or distributed error handling strategies

## Alternatives Considered

Tower is the standard middleware system for Axum, so no alternatives were seriously considered. It provides:

- A well-designed middleware abstraction
- Excellent integration with Axum
- Battle-tested implementation
- High performance characteristics

## Performance Characteristics

- Minimal overhead for service composition
- Efficient handling of request processing
- Scales well with additional middleware layers
- Memory usage correlates with middleware complexity

## Security Considerations

- Tower itself doesn't implement security features
- Security middleware (authentication, authorization) can be built using Tower
- Service abstractions allow clean separation of security concerns
- Proper middleware ordering is essential for security guarantees

## Future Considerations

- Tower has a stable API with minimal breaking changes expected
- Additional middleware may be added as project requirements evolve
- Custom middleware development may be needed for specialized features
- Performance monitoring of middleware stack to identify bottlenecks
